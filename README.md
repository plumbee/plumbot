# Plumbot

A Clojure library to host slack bots.

## Usage

The Plumbot uses Stuart Sierra's [component library](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

To begin, call `com.plumbee.plumbot.system/plumbot-system` to obtain a system map.
Then call `com.stuartsierra.component/start` and `com.stuartsierra.component/stop` on this map to start and stop the system.

Bots are records of type `com.plumbee.plumbot.register/Bot` and can be installed by calling
 `com.plumbee.plumbot.register/register-bot!` on them.

See the [example namespace](doc/example.clj) for a concrete example or for a more in
depth example take a look at our [Build Bot](https://github.com/plumbee/buildbot).

### Configuration subsystem

The Plumbot provides a couple of configuration loading methods.

`load-data` reads [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) (Clojure data) from the filesystem.
`persistent-atom` performs a similar action, but stores the result in an atom, and propagates changes to the atom back to the file system.

Hence, `load-data` is more suitable for static config, and `persistent-atom` is more suitable for bot state that you wish to survive a restart.
At Plumbee our bot is backed by [EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) so that state survives when the stack is rebuilt.

If you don't know what config to provide, try starting the bot, and then see what configuration files are created.

Note that both methods only read once (at evaluation time) from the file system and that `persistent-atom` may overwrite manual changes to the file.
Thus it is best to stop the Plumbot while editing config files.
