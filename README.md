# Plumbot

A Clojure library to host slack bots.

## Usage

The Plumbot uses Stuart Sierra's [component library](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

To begin, call `com.plumbee.plumbot.system/plumbot-system` to obtain a system map.
Then call `com.stuartsierra.component/start` and `com.stuartsierra.component/stop` on this map to start and stop the system.

Bots are records of type `com.plumbee.plumbot.register/Bot` and can be installed by calling
 `com.plumbee.plumbot.register/register-bot!` on them.

See the [example namespace](doc/example.clj) for a concrete example.
